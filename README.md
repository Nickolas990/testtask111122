# testtask111122


<h1> Test task from 11.11.22</h1>

<h3><b>Author: </b>Nikolay Melnikov</h3>

<p>
 Packages are located in src/main/java directory
    As you can see, I used maven project to make test task, because I was needed Jackson Library for task3.
    report.json generates in the same package as task3 located in. <br><b>Please, pay attention</b>, that new report.json generated each time you start app.
    I hadn't any instructions for this type of generating, so I made as I thought.
    Thank you for attention to my resume and for test tasks.
    Best regards,
    Nikolay Melnikov
